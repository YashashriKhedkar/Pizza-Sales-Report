📊 Power BI Project: Pizza Sales Report (Data Analytics Project)
🚀 I'm excited to share a recent Power BI project I completed — a Pizza Sales Report analyzing one full year of business performance (Jan–Dec 2015). This project demonstrates my end-to-end data analytics skills, from data cleaning and transformation to insightful dashboard design using the ETL process.

🔧 My Process (ETL Framework)
📌 Extract:
I imported messy raw data from multiple Excel files containing order, product, and sales information.

📌 Transform (Power Query Editor):

Cleaned missing values using computed logic (e.g., average or default fills)

Standardized data types and corrected formats

Created calculated and conditional columns for KPIs (e.g., Average Pizzas per Order)

Removed duplicates and fixed header issues

Established table relationships for model accuracy

📌 Load:
Loaded the cleaned and modeled data into Power BI, where I built a fully interactive dashboard.
