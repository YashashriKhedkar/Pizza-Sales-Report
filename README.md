### *🚀 I'm excited to share a recent Power BI project I completed — a Pizza Sales Report analyzing one full year of business performance (Jan–Dec 2015). This project demonstrates my end-to-end data analytics skills, from data cleaning and transformation to insightful dashboard design using the ETL process.*

* Standardized data types and corrected formats
* Created calculated and conditional columns for KPIs (e.g., Average Pizzas per Order)
* Removed duplicates and fixed header issues
* Established table relationships for model accuracy

### **📌 Load:**
